# Airline Satisfaction Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying airline passenger satisfaction based on various features.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger is satisfied or not based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:

- Flight Distance
- Inflight wifi service
- Departure/Arrival time convenient
- Ease of Online booking
- Gate location
- Food and drink
- Online boarding
- Seat comfort
- Inflight entertainment
- On-board service
- Leg room service
- Baggage handling
- Checkin service
- Inflight service
- Cleanliness
- Departure Delay in Minutes
- Arrival Delay in Minutes

## Notebook Contents

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
